# UserField extension for Bugzilla
# License: Mozilla Public License 2.0 (same as Bugzilla itself)
#
# Turns one or more existing "Free Text" custom fields (type cf_xxx) into a
# user picker: the value must be the login name of an existing Bugzilla
# account, and the field is shown as a real <select> dropdown listing every
# Bugzilla user - the same list and visibility rules used for Assignee /
# QA Contact when Administration -> Parameters -> User Matching ->
# "usemenuforusers" is switched on.
#
# HOW IT WORKS
#   1. object_validators  - whenever a bug is created or edited (through the
#      web UI, email_in.pl, or the REST/XML-RPC API), the value entered for
#      each field listed in USER_FIELDS is resolved against Bugzilla's user
#      list and normalised to a canonical login name. An invalid login
#      throws Bugzilla's normal "no such user" error. This still applies
#      even though the web UI itself only ever submits values that came
#      from the dropdown - it's what keeps the API/email_in.pl paths safe.
#   2. template_before_process - tells bug/field.html.tmpl which fields are
#      "user fields", by injecting a lookup hash into the template variables.
#   3. template/en/default/hook/bug/field-end_field_column.html.tmpl
#      - the actual hook template. For fields listed in USER_FIELDS, it
#      prints a <select> populated from user.get_userlist (Bugzilla's own
#      "every visible user" list - the exact same one Assignee/QA Contact
#      use), and disables the plain <input> that bug/field.html.tmpl
#      already rendered above it for the FREETEXT field type, so only the
#      <select>'s value gets submitted.
#
# INSTALLATION
#   1. Copy this whole "UserField" directory into Bugzilla's extensions/
#      directory, so you end up with extensions/UserField/Extension.pm etc.
#   2. In Administration -> Custom Fields, create a "Free Text" field
#      (e.g. cf_owner). Do NOT try to select a "User" type - it doesn't
#      exist in stock Bugzilla; Free Text is correct here.
#   3. Add the field's name to the USER_FIELDS list below.
#   4. Run ./checksetup.pl from the Bugzilla root once, so Bugzilla picks
#      up the new extension and recompiles its templates.
#   5. Restart Apache/mod_perl if you run Bugzilla under mod_perl (plain
#      CGI installs don't need a restart).
#
# LIMITATIONS
#   - One login per field (like Assignee/QA Contact), not a multi-user list
#     like CC. A true multi-select would need <select multiple> plus
#     changing _check_user_field below to validate a list of logins instead
#     of one.
#   - The dropdown lists every enabled account (same as Assignee/QA
#     Contact) - there's no group restriction on who can be picked. If you
#     need to restrict it to a group, filter the FOREACH loop in the hook
#     template to accounts where $u has your group (you'll need to pass a
#     pre-filtered list in via template_before_process instead of calling
#     user.get_userlist directly in the template), and also check
#     $user->in_group('your_group') in _check_user_field below so the
#     restriction holds for the API/email_in.pl paths too.
#   - The value is stored as plain text (the field is a real FREETEXT
#     field), so advanced search operators specific to user fields (like
#     "is one of my bugs") don't apply - only text search operators do.
#   - On installs with a LOT of users, a plain <select> with everyone in it
#     gets unwieldy. If that's your situation, an autocomplete text box is
#     usually nicer than a giant dropdown - ask and I can put that version
#     together instead.
